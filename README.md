Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses a significant healthcare challenge, with an escalating prevalence and a forecasted surge in affected individuals. The urgency for precise diagnostic tools to enable early interventions and improved patient care is evident. Despite advancements, existing detection frameworks exhibit limitations in accurately identifying AD, especially in its early stages. This paper aims to address this critical research gap by introducing ConvADD, an advanced Convolutional Neural Network architecture tailored for AD detection. By meticulously designing ConvADD, this study endeavours to surpass the limitations of current methodologies and enhance the accuracy and reliability of AD diagnosis. Through rigorous experimentation, ConvADD demonstrates remarkable performance metrics, showcasing its potential as a robust and effective tool for AD detection. However, despite its promising results, several challenges and limitations remain, such as generalizability across diverse populations and the need for further validation studies. By elucidating these gaps and challenges, this paper contributes to the ongoing discourse on improving AD detection methodologies and lays the groundwork for future research endeavours in this domain.![image](https://github.com/MAlsubaie/ConvADD/assets/85856229/562dcac3-7562-4700-a938-5d224756c97d)
